# emoji-shortname
Replace emoji short names with their corresponding emojis.

## Overview
The short names we are familiar with (e.g. the ones used on sites like GitHub)
are not inline with the [CLDR short names][1] defined in the Unicode standard.
This makes mapping short codes to emojis a bit of a challenge. So, I punt on
this issue, and defer to the [emoji package][2] created by [Taehoon Kim and Kevin Wurster][3].
Their wonderful library does the heavy lifting.  

This extension amounts to a find-and-replace. Find the short name, replace it with the
appropriate emoji. It works with both `Markdown` and `reStructuredText`.

## Details
Emojis are added to documents by sandwiching their short names between colons.
For example, `:smile:` resolves to :smile:. This syntax conflicts with
the way you provide options to directives in Sphinx. And, since the extension
ties into the [source-read hook][4], those directives are yet to be resolved.
As such, if an option shares the same name as an emoji short code, the option
will be replaced by the emoji. Though I am unaware of any case where this happens,
be aware that it is a possibility.

## Development
The project is managed with [poetry][5].  

To contribute to `emoji-shortname`, first [install poetry][6]. Once installed,
fetch the project dependencies with `poetry install`. From here, you can
iterate on the code and run the unit tests with `poetry run tox pyproject.toml`

## Usage
Simply install the package with your manager of choice (e.g. poetry, pip, etc)
and then add the extension to your sphinx `config.py`.
```python
extensions = ["emoji_shortname"]
```
